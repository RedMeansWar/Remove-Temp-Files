# Remove-Temp-Files
An exe file that clears out temporary files from your appdata and temporary windows files and if it encounters any errors it will skip over them.
Feel free to use or edit the source code (that's what it's for :D) that I have but if you use it I only ask that you give credit. Let me know if you
encounter any bugs or if you want me to add stuff, see ya!

When you extract this make sure you put import the XML file into your task scheduler.
